<p>This digital health trust network is a network of stakeholders that securely exchange and uses health information based on trust, security, and privacy principles, and is designed to ensure that health information is handled in a secure, private, and compliant manner.  Through the GDHCN, WHO serves as the custodian of a digital health trust network.</p>

<p>In addition to the key concepts used throughout this document, which are defined below, additional documentation may be found on:</p>

<h3 id="public-health-security-agency">Public Health Security Agency</h3>
<p>An organization, or organizational unit, that is responsible for establishing procedures for and/or implementing required activities, both proactive and reactive, for minimizing the danger and impact of acute public health events that endanger people’s health across geographical regions and international boundaries.  See: https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-security.</p>

<h3 id="public-key-infrastructure-pki">Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</h3>
<p>The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the trust model based on public key certificates and certificate authorities.  It is the means for publishing and distributing Trust Lists comprising the public keys that can be used to digitally verify the issuer of a Verifiable Digital Health Certificates.</p>

<h3 id="signing-certificate-authority-sca">Signing Certificate Authority (SCA)</h3>
<p>Each Trust Network Participant maintains one or more Signing Certificate Authority (SCA), certificates of which are relatively long lived. The SCA issues public key certificates for the national, short lived, Document Signers.  The SCA acts as a trust anchor such that relying Trust Network Participants can use the SCA certificate to validate the authenticity and integrity of the regularly changing DSC certificates</p>

<h3 id="technical-representative">Technical Representative</h3>
<p>The individual designated by a GDHCN Participant as having the primary overall responsibility for the security, technical matters and systems infrastructure of this GDHCN Participant for the applicable Trust Domain including ensuring compliance with technical specifications.</p>

<h3 id="terms-of-participation-top">Terms of Participation (TOP)</h3>
<p>Participation in the GDHCN is subject to the Onboarding Process set forth by the GDHCN Secretariat in its sole and absolute discretion, and in accordance with WHO rules, regulations, policies and practices, as may be amended from time to time.
The requirements for the GDHCN Terms of Participation are comprised of the following components:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>TOP0</em></strong> Sharing of necessary credentials to establish an mTLS (mutual transport layer security) connection between a GDHCN Participant’s backend system(s) and the Trust Network Gateway;</li>
  <li><strong><em>TOP1</em></strong> Compliance, during initial Onboarding Process and during routine validation periods, with technical specifications required for a PKI;</li>
  <li><strong><em>TOP2</em></strong> Compliance, during initial Onboarding Process and during routine validation periods, with technical specifications for Verifiable Digital Health Certificates and APIs of Trusted Services for each applicable Trust Domain;</li>
  <li><strong><em>TOP3</em></strong> Compliance with policy and regulatory standards that GDHCN Participants pertaining to Trusted Services that a GDHCN Trust Participants operates or utilizes for each applicable Trust Domain; and</li>
  <li><strong><em>TOP4</em></strong> Provision of supporting documentation (e.g. mandate, legal framework) demonstrating that it is an Eligible GDHCN Participant, as may be requested by WHO, at its sole discretion, from time to time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="trust-domain">Trust Domain</h3>
<p>A Trust Domain consists of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Defined use cases and business processes related to the utilization of Verifiable Digital Health Certificates;</li>
  <li>the open, interoperable technical specifications that identify or define the applicable Trusted Services and Verifiable Digital Health Certificates; and</li>
  <li>a set of policy and regulatory standards describing expected behavior of GDHCN Participants in relation to operation of the Trusted Services and utilization of Verifiable Digital Health Certificates (e.g. data minimization, privacy, scope of use).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="trust-lists">Trust Lists</h3>
<p>Universal verifier applications that support different credential standards are complicated by wide variability in format of the credential payloads, signatures, key formats, and key distribution methods. Public keys formats include x509 certificates, JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS), and DID documents. Signing key distribution methods include API gateways, hosted by issuer at a pre-defined URL, embedded in certificates, and by block-chain based resolution. Establishing root of trust by trust anchor or distributing trust list has been accomplished by API gateway, hosted URL, private dissemination and other bilateral sharing agreements.</p>

<p>While some variability is expected in an approach that preserves sovereignty, there are opportunities for alignment in key format and distribution for the sake of fostering interoperability. With that goal, we provide a unifying trust list format to assemble and share public key infrastructure for all credential specifications used by existing trust networks. Importantly, this format does not enforce a particular policy framework for participants of the trust network.</p>

<p>The GDHCN currently supports two means for key distribution of keys using trust lists</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="concepts_certificate_governance.html">EU DCC API</a> <strong>required</strong></li>
  <li><a href="concepts_did.html">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> optional</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="trust-network">Trust Network</h3>
<p>A Trust Network is a means to authenticate the encryption public keys used by participants within a network to perform encryption services, verify digital signatures, establish secure connections between systems, and otherwise make use of encryption public keys.</p>
<p><strong>Trust Network</strong></p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<h3 id="trust-network-gateway-tng">Trust Network Gateway (TNG)</h3>
<p>The Trust Network Gateway (TNG) is the open-source software and its IT operational infrastructure, utilizing open standards, for a Public Key Infrastructure and metadata management services which is used to operationalize one or more Trust Domains.</p>

<h4 id="trust-network-gateway---trust-anchor--tngta">Trust Network Gateway - Trust Anchor  (TNG<sub>TA</sub>)</h4>
