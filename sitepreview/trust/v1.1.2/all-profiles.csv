The full data structure and encoding mechanisms for HCERT are defined here: [Electronic Health Certificate Specification](/smart-trust/hcert_spec.html)

An HCERT is claim -260 within the [CBOR Web Token (CWT) Claim](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8392.html).

Note for subclaims:
- subclaims 0 and above are reserved by WHO to be assigned, a new sub claim can be requested for by requesting to create a new trust domain
- subclaims for negative integer values are for development purposes and are free to use
- While this logical model mentions assigned subclaims (below), the ones listed in the Electronic Health Certificate Specification are considered authoritative
