<p>Functional requirements are documented in the <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Digital_certificates-vaccination-2021.1">Digital Documentation of COVID-19 Certificates (DDCC): Vaccination Status (DDCC:VS)</a> and the <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Digital_certificates_diagnostic_test_results-2022.1">DDCC: Test Result (DDCC:TR) - Technical Specifications and Implementation Guidance</a>.</p>

<p>The high-level functional requirements are written as guidance requirements only to be used as a starting point for Member States or other interested parties that need to develop their own specifications for a digital solution for DDCC to take and adapt.</p>

<p>The following includes functional requirements for DDCC:VS and DDCC:TR, along with mappings to use cases, as well as related requirements.</p>

<h3 id="requirement-conventions">Requirement conventions</h3>
<p>The DDCC guidance uses specific terminology in requirements. The definitions are based on the definitions published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>MAY</strong> is used to describe technical features and functions that are optional, and it is the implementer’s decision on whether
 to include that feature or function based on the implementation context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SHALL</strong> is used to describe technical features and functions that are mandatory for this specification.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SHOULD</strong> is used to describe technical features and functions that are recommended, but they are not mandatory. It is the
 implementer’s decision on whether to include that feature or function based on the implementation context. However, the
 implementer is highly recommended to review the reasons for not following the recommendations before deviating from the
 technical specifications outlined.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ddccvs---continuity-of-care-requirements">DDCC:VS - Continuity of Care requirements</h3>
<p>As the Test Result guidance does not include the Continuity of Care scenario, there are fewer related requirements for the DDCC:VS Continuity of Care scenario.</p>

<h3 id="ddcctr---certificate-generation-requirements">DDCC:TR - Certificate Generation requirements</h3>
<p>Processes for specimen collection, data collection, sample analysis and the generation of test reports (if required) will be defined by Member States, are outside the scope of the DDCC:TR guidance, and are preconditions for generating a test result certificate. Member States will need to define how a certificate will be generated, issued and adapted to their own contexts and levels of digital maturity, in compliance with their legal and policy frameworks. Due to these preconditions and differences, mappings to use cases are not included for DDCC:TR certificate generation.</p>
