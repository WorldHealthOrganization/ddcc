","Certificate - DIVOC Verifiable Credential Logical Model","Data elements for the DIVOC Core Data Set.

The official DIVOC documentation appears to be at <https://divoc.digit.org>. However, this does not include a full list of elements included in DIVOC certificates.

There is a JSON-LD context referenced in DIVOC certificate examples (`https://cowin.gov.in/credentials/vaccination/v1`), which would provide some element-level information, but this URL does not resolve. There is a copy of this JSON-LD context at <https://github.com/egovernments/DIVOC/blob/main/vaccination-context/vaccination-context.js>.

It was not possible to find any online documentation regarding DIVOC proof of testing. Information on this was provided by the DIVOC team via email.

Some element descriptions in this logical model provide details that are not in publicly available DIVOC documentation.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Base",0,*,"",""
