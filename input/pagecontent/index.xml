  <h3>Summary</h3> <a name="summary"> </a>


  <p>
    This implementation guide contains a standards-compliant specifications for the DDCC:VS technical specifications and guidance document. The implementation guide explicitly encodes computer-interoperable logic, including data models, terminologies, and logic expressions, in a computable language to support implementation of continuity of care and proof of vaccination use cases by Member States.
