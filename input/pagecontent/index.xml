  <h3>Summary</h3> <a name="summary"> </a>

  <p>
    This implementation guide contains a standards-compliant specifications for the DDCC: Vaccination Status and Test Result technical specifications and guidance documents. It explicitly encodes computer-interoperable logic, including data models, terminologies, and logic expressions, in a computable language to support implementation of vaccination and test result use cases by Member States.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To facilitate implementation of effective and interoperable digital solutions:
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Digital_certificates-vaccination-2021.1">DDCC: Vaccination Status (DDCC:VS) technical specifications and implementation guidance </a>was issued for vaccination certificates for the purposes of continuity of care and proof of vaccination.</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Digital_certificates_diagnostic_test_results-2022.1">DDCC: Test Result (DDCC:TR) technical specifications and implementation guidance</a> is being issued for test result certificates that attests to: (a) the fact that an individual has been tested for SARS-CoV-2, and (b) the result of that SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The DDCC documents contain overviews of high-level use cases for digital COVID-19 certificates, including: 
        <ul>
          <li>workflows;</li>
          <li>core data elements mapped to standard code systems;</li>
          <li>functional and non-functional requirements;</li>
          <li>an overview of digitally signing and verifying a certificate with public key infrastructure (PKI) technology;</li>
          <li>implementation guidance regarding ethical considerations, privacy and data protection principles;</li>
          <li>national governance considerations;</li>
          <li>and this linked FHIR Implementation Guide for the DDCC scope. </li>
        </ul>
  </p>
