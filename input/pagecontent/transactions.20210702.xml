  <h3 id="submit-health-event">Submit Health Event</h3> 
  The Submit Health Event transaction is initiated by a <a href="actors.html#point-of-care">Point of Care</a> system against the <a href="actors.html#ddcc-generator">DDCC Generator</a>.

  {% include submit_health_event.svg %}
  

  <h4  id="submit-health-event-trigger">Trigger Event </h4>
  The Submit Health Event transaction may be initiated in any of the following ways:
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="actors.html#point-of-care">Point of Care</a> system is online and a health event was recorded by the Vaccinator or the Data Entry Personnel</li>
    <li>The <a href="actors.html#point-of-care">Point of Care</a> system comes online after recording one or more health events while in an offline mode</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="register-health-certificate-message-semantics">Message Semantics</h4>

  <h5 id="register-health-certificate-message-semantics-request"> Message Semantics Request</h5>
    The message semantics for the Register Health  Certificate transaction utilizes a <a href="StructureDefinition-DDCCSubmitHealthEventRequest.html">DDCC Submit Health Event Request</a> which is a batch Bundle of <a href="StructureDefinition-DDCCGenerateHealthCertificateParameters.html">Parameters</a> for the <a href="OperationDefinition-DDCC-QuestionnaireReponse-generateHealthCertificate.html">Generate Health Certificate Operation</a> which include <a href="StructureDefinition-DDCCQQuestionnaireResponse.html">DDCC Questionnaire Response</a> resources for the request message. The specific DDCC Questionnaire Response resource is determined by the health event that is the subject of the transaction  
  
  <h5 id="register-health-certificate-message-semantics-response"> Message Semantics Response</h5>
    The response to a Register Health Certificate transaction is a <a href="StructureDefinition-DDCCSubmitHealthEventResponse.html">DDCC Submit Health Event Response</a> which consists of a Bundle of type batch-response following the FHIR specification for <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#transaction-response">transaction responses</a>.  

  <h4 id="submit-health-event-preconditions"> Pre-conditions</h4>
  The DDCC Generator should have a Document Signing Certificate (DSC) issued by the Public Health Authority and registered with an approved Public Key Directory such as the <a href="actors.html#npkd">National Public Key Directory</a>.  

  When a jurisdiction participates in the Digital-Online scenario, the DSC should be registered with an approved Public Key Directory.
  
  <h4 id="submit-health-event-expected-actions"> Expected Actions</h4>
  The following are the expected actions for the actors participating in this transaction:
  <ul>

      <ol>
	<li>serialize the <a href="StructureDefinition-DDCCQuestionnaireResponse.html">DDCC Questionnaire Response</a> content as payload for encoding as a QR code</li>
	<li>use their DSC to sign the QR Code Content as part of the QR Content schema</li>
	<li>return the generated signed <a href="StructureDefinition-DDCCDocument.html">DDCC Document</a> to the  <a href="actors.html#point-of-care">Point of Care</a> system</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      If a jurisdiction participates in the Digital-Online scenario, the <a href="actors.html#ddcc-generator">DDCC Generator</a> should:
