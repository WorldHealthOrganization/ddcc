    <tr><td>UC006</td><td>Manual verification</td><td>A Verifier verifies a DDCC:VS using purely visual means, based on his or her subjective judgement, as is currently done with International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis. This type of check is currently well accepted, is quick and easy to do, and requires no digital technology.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>UC007</td><td>Offline cryptographic verification</td><td>A Verifier verifies a DDCC:VS using digital cryptographic processes in an offline mode.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>UC008</td><td>Online status check (national DDCC:VS)</td><td>This pathway is used when the DDCC:VS is being verified in the same jurisdiction as it was issued. A Verifier verifies a DDCC:VS using digital cryptographic processes in an online mode that includes a status check against the PHA’s DDCC:VS Registry Service and optionally the DDCC:VS Repository.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>UC009</td><td>Online status check (international DDCC:VS)</td><td>This pathway is used when the DDCC:VS is being verified in a foreign jurisdiction to where it was issued. A Verifier verifies an internationally issued DDCC:VS using digital cryptographic processes in an online mode that includes a status check against the National PHA’s DDCC:VS Registry Service, which in turn accesses an International PHA’s DDCC:VS Registry and DDCC:VS Repository, if such services exist and such access is authorized by the issuing PHA. It is assumed in this workflow that a Verifier does not directly access an International PHA’s DDCC:VS Registry or Repository Service.</td></tr>
