    Business process diagrams for each of the <a href="use_cases.html">Use Cases</a> are included in the Digital Documentation of COVID-19 Certificates (DDCC): Vaccination Status (DDCC:VS) and Test Result (DDCC:TR) â€” Technical Specifications and Implementation Guidance.</p>
  This page includes sequence diagrams with DDCC actors (described in the <a href="actors.html">Actors</a>) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) references, and includes options, such as the use of QR codes and a DDCC Repository Service. 

   <h3  id="workflows_and_transactions">Workflows and Transactions </h3>
 
 The following diagram illustrates the business requirement workflows as realized through the system level <a href="transactions.html">transactions</a>. As the DDCC:TR has preconditions and does not include the test event, its process starts when the certificate is generated and it is not included in the Continuity of Care scenario.
